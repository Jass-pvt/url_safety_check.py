A Python tool to analyze URLs for safety using SSL checks, WHOIS domain info, phishing heuristics, and optional VirusTotal / Google Safe Browsing APIs.

🔒 URL Safety Checker is a Python-based tool that evaluates the security of any URL.  
It performs multiple layers of analysis, including:
- Heuristic detection of suspicious patterns in URLs.
- SSL/TLS certificate validation.
- WHOIS domain age lookup.
- Webpage content analysis (forms, phishing keywords).


Helps in identifying potentially malicious, phishing, or unsafe websites.
